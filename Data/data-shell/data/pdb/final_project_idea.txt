I am in a research group with Dr.Domyan and Dr.Hough, the research group is working on modifying an Algea, Chlamydamonas Reinhartii, to perform Nitrogen and Phosphate remidiation to help prevent algeal blooms. In dong this research I have become curious about if it is possible to predict algeal blooms based on temperature of lakes.
The resources that I am going to use for this project are mainly going to be the professors that I am working with and our connections that we have made in the duration of this project. 
The data would show the location, temperature, fresh water or salt water and amount of algae present
